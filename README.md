**Inspiration**
We love music and we hope more people can be healed by music.

**What it does**
It allows people to categorize the songs that they can listen to in different moods.

**How we built it**
We use HTML, CSS, and javascript to make the website, and use flask in python as a framework to display the page. We also use web local storage to store the name of music.

**Challenges we ran into**
When transferring code between devices, many functions do not run when switching devices.

**Accomplishments that we're proud of**
We applied what we learn from COMP 202 and really made something.

**What we learned**
We learned about the front-end in a short amount of time and have a deeper understanding of Python.

**What's next for Therapeutic Playlist**
We will learn about the back-end and use a database to store the users' information, so the login system will work.
